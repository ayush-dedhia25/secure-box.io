						<p>
							If you're worried about someone hacking your account and posting on Instagram without your authorization, setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) is a must.
							By requiring a second form of authentication after you enter your password, a hacker can't access your account without physical access to your connected device, even if they have your password.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<h5>To set it up</h5>
							<li>Go to profile and click on <i class="far fa-bars black"></i> icon</li>
							<li>Select the settings option <i class="fal fa-cog black"></i></li>
							<li>Select <b>Security</b> > <b>Two Factor Authentication</b> > <b>Get Started</b></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							You can then choose to set up 2FA through text message or an independent authentication app, such as Google Authenticator.
						</p>
						<p>
							If your phone is having connectivity issues and can't receive an SMS security code, that's where recovery codes come in.
							Go to <b>Settings</b> > <b>Security</b> > <b>Two Factor Authentication</b> > <b>Recovery Codes</b> and use the displayed code to login.

							<i class="fad fa-caret-square-down" data-collapse-btn></i>
						</a>
					</div>
					<div class="option-collapsable-body" data-option-body>
						<p>To help keep your account secure, we recommend the following best practices:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use a strong password that you don’t reuse on other websites.</li>
							<li>Use two-factor authentication.</li>
							<li>Require email and phone number to request a reset password link or code.</li>
							<li>Be cautious of suspicious links and always make sure you’re on twitter.com before you enter your login information.</li>
							<li>Never give your username and password out to third parties, especially those promising to get you followers, make you money, or verify you.</li>
							<li>Make sure your computer software, including your browser, is up-to-date with the most recent upgrades and anti-virus software.</li>
							<li>Check to see if your account has been compromised.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h5>Password Strength</h5>
						<p>
							Create a strong and unique password for your Twitter account.
							You should also create an equally strong and unique password for the email address associated with your Twitter account.
						</p>
						
						Do's: <br>
						
						<ul>
							<li><b>Do</b> create a password at least 10 characters long. Longer is better.</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> use a different password for each website you visit.</li>
							<li><b>Do</b> keep your password in a safe place. Consider using password management software to store all of your login information securely.</li>
						</ul>
						
						Don'ts: <br>
						
						<ul>
							<li><b>Do not</b> use personal information in your password such as phone numbers, birthdays, etc.</li>
							<li><b>Do not</b> use common dictionary words such as “password”, “iloveyou”, etc.</li>
							<li><b>Do not</b> use sequences such as ”abcd1234”, or keyboard sequences like “qwerty”.</li>
							<li><b>Do not</b> reuse passwords across websites. Your Twitter account password should be unique to Twitter.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>
							Additionally, you can select Require personal information to reset my password in your Account settings.
							If you check this box, you will be prompted to enter either your email address or phone number, or your email address then phone number if both are associated with your account to send a reset password link or confirmation code if you ever forget it.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</h5>
						<p>
							Two-factor authentication is an extra layer of security for your account.
							Instead of relying on a password only, two-factor authentication introduces a second check to help make sure that you, and only you, can access your Twitter account.
							Only people who have access to both your password and your mobile phone (or a security key) will be able to log in to your account.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Twitter won't contact you asking for your password</h5>
						<p>
							Twitter will never ask you to provide your password via email, Direct Message, or reply.
							<br><br>
							We will never ask you to download something or sign-in to a non-Twitter website.
							Never open an attachment or install any software from an email that claims to be from us; it's not.
							<br><br>
							If we suspect your account has been phished or hacked, we may reset your password to prevent the hacker from misusing your account.
							In this case, we'll email you a twitter.com password reset link.
							<br><br>
							If you forget your password, you can reset it via this link.
						</p>
						
						<h5>New and suspicious login alerts</h5>
						<p>
							If we detect a suspicious login or when you log in to your Twitter account from a new device for the first time, we will send you a push notification within the Twitter app, or via email as an extra layer of security for your account.
							Login alerts are only sent following new logins through Twitter for iOS and Android, twitter.com, and mobile web.
							<br><br>
							Through these alerts, you can verify that it was you who logged in from the device.
							If you did not log in from the device, you should follow the steps in the notification to secure your account, starting by changing your Twitter password immediately.
							Please note that the location listed in the notification is an approximate location derived from the IP address you used to access Twitter, and it may be different from your physical location.
							<br><br>
							<b>Note:</b> If you log in to your Twitter account from incognito browsers or browsers with cookies disabled, you will receive an alert each time.

							Securing your YouTube account helps prevent your account from being hacked, hijacked, or compromised.
							<br><br>
							<b>Note:</b> If you think your account has been hacked, follow these steps to secure it.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Create a strong password and keep it safe</h5>
						<p>
							A strong password helps you keep your personal information safe and prevents someone else from getting into your account.
						</p>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Create a strong and complex password:</b> Use 8 characters or more. It can be any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
							<li><b>Make your password unique:</b> Do not use your YouTube account password on other sites. If another site gets hacked, the password could be used to enter your YouTube account.</li>
							<li><b>Avoid personal information and common words:</b> Do not use personal information like your birthdays, common words like “password,” or common patterns like “1234".</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h5>Do a regular security checkup</h5>
						<p>Go to the Security Checkup page to get personalized security recommendations for your account and follow these tips to make your account more secure.</p>
						
						<h5>Protect against suspicious messages & content</h5>
						<p>
							Phishing is when a hacker disguises themself as someone trustworthy to take personal information, like financial data, a national ID/social security number, or credit card numbers.
							<br><br>
							Hackers may pretend to be institutions, family members, or colleagues by using emails, text messages, web pages, and more.
							<br><br>
							YouTube will never ask you for your password, email address, or other account information. Don't be fooled if someone contacts you pretending to be from YouTube.
						</p>
						
						<h5>Set & check permissions on your channel</h5>
						<p>
							If you’re a creator, you can invite someone else to manage your YouTube channel without giving access to your Google Account.
							Invite someone to access their channel as a:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Manager:</b> Can add or remove others and edit channel details.</li>
							<li><b>Editor:</b> Can edit all channel details.</li>
							<li><b>Viewer:</b> Can view (but not edit) all channel details.</li>
							<li><b>Viewer (limited):</b> Can view (but not edit) all channel details except revenue information.</li>
						</ul>
